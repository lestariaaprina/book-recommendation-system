# Book Recommendation System
## Introduction
Hello world! I am Lestari Aprina, and this is my first end-to-end data science project.

## About The Project
The main objective of this project is to create a book recommendation system for users.

I got the datasets from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset/data

The project stages consist of:
  1. Data understanding and data preprocessing
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Popularity-Based Filtering
  4. Collaborative Filtering (Model-Based and Memory-Based)

The project result summary:
  1. The top 5 most-rated books were essentially novels.
  2. The majority of the users were in the age range of 20â€“30, and most of them came from the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, and Spain.
  3. The authors with the most books were Agatha Christie, William Shakespeare, and Stephen King.
  4. Most of the books have high ratings with maximum books being rated 8.
  5. The model-based collaborative filtering SVD technique worked way better than NMF with lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  6. The memory-based collaborative filtering, item-item based collaborative filtering performed better than user-user based collaborative filtering because of lower computation.


## Closing Statement
I value feedback about my project and what I could do better, and I would be grateful to hear your thoughts on ways I could be more effective.

Thank you in advance.
